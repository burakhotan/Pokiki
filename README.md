# Pokiki

A program to divide an image to sub samples and replace them with desired photos written in Python 3.6.4. There currently are 2 steps to running this program. 

## Getting Started

First you have to create and populate the **tiles** folder with the replacement images you desire and then run **listBuilder.py** with the following command:

```
python listBuilder.py
```

Which generates a JSON file with the information about the tiles.

And then edit Program.py with the desired parameters (update coming soon to lessen the hassle). After editing and saving run it with:

```
python Program.py
```
